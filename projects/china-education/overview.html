                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Schools clearly boost cognitive skills—but do they shape personality? Research shows non-cognitive skills like locus of control predict earnings and employment as powerfully as IQ, yet we know surprisingly little about whether formal schooling causally affects these traits. Locus of control measures whether people believe effort determines success (internal) versus luck and connections (external). While correlational evidence suggests more educated people are more internal, this could reflect selection: perhaps internally-oriented people simply invest more in education because they believe it pays off.</p>

                        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Does compulsory education causally increase internal locus of control?</li>
                            <li>If education matters, what's the mechanism—does schooling strengthen belief in effort, or weaken belief in luck?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>China's 1986 Compulsory Schooling Law created a natural experiment. The law mandated 9 years of education nationwide, but implementation varied dramatically: Beijing's enrollment was already 95% while Guizhou's was 39%. Combined with staggered rollout (1986-1994), this creates the variation needed to identify causal effects. If two otherwise-identical teenagers experienced different educational attainment purely because one lived in a province that aggressively enforced the law, do their personalities diverge years later?</p>
