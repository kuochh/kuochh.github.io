                        <h3>Data</h3>
                        <p>China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2010: ~16,500 adults born 1964-1992 across 25 provinces. Locus of control measured through 10 survey questions—five external (success depends on luck, family wealth, social status, connections) and five internal (success depends on effort, education, hard work, intellect, talent). Responses combined into a standardized index increasing in the internal direction.</p>

                        <h3>Identification Strategy</h3>
                        <p>Difference-in-differences instrumental variables design exploiting two dimensions of variation:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Provincial intensity:</strong> Baseline proportion without junior high completion among 21-25 year-olds in 1986, ranging from 5% (Beijing) to 61% (Guizhou). High-intensity provinces saw larger enrollment increases.</li>

                            <li><strong>Cohort exposure:</strong> Individuals aged 6-15 when their province implemented the law received varying exposure years. Those age ≤6 were fully treated; those age ≥15 were untreated; ages 7-14 received partial treatment proportional to remaining compulsory years.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Innovation</h3>
                        <p>The interaction Treatment × Intensity instruments for educational attainment, isolating compliers—individuals who completed junior high specifically because of the law. This addresses both selection bias and measurement error. Region-specific birth-year fixed effects control for differential economic growth and school quality improvements across China's six regions, addressing the main identification threat.</p>
