                        <h3>Data</h3>
                        <p>China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2010: ~16,500 adults born 1964-1992 across 25 provinces. Locus of control is measured through 10 survey questions: five external (success depends on luck, family wealth, social status, connections) and five internal (success depends on effort, education, hard work, intellect, talent). Responses combined into a standardized index increasing in the internal direction.</p>

                        <h3>Identification Strategy</h3>
                        <p>Difference-in-differences instrumental variables design exploiting two dimensions of variation:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Provincial intensity:</strong> Baseline proportion without junior high completion among 21-25 year-olds in 1986, ranging from 5% (Beijing) to 61% (Guizhou). High-intensity provinces saw larger enrollment increases.</li>

                            <li><strong>Cohort exposure:</strong> Individuals aged 6-15 when their province implemented the law received varying exposure years. Those age ≤6 were fully treated; those age ≥15 were untreated; ages 7-14 received partial treatment proportional to remaining compulsory years.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Innovation</h3>
                        <p>The interaction Treatment × Intensity instruments for educational attainment, isolating compliers (individuals who completed junior high specifically because of the law). This addresses both selection bias and measurement error. Region-specific birth-year fixed effects control for differential economic growth and school quality improvements across China's six regions, addressing the main identification threat.</p>
