                        <h3>First Stage</h3>
                        <p>The law worked. Fully-treated individuals in high-intensity provinces (45% baseline non-completion) were 21% more likely to complete junior high and obtained 0.85 additional years of schooling versus low-intensity provinces (5% baseline). Effects concentrated among females and rural residents—groups initially least likely to attend school.</p>

                        <h3>Main Finding</h3>
                        <p><strong>Completing junior high school increases locus of control by 0.84 standard deviations.</strong> One additional year increases it by 0.26 SD. For scale: this rivals the effect on math scores (0.93 SD) and exceeds half the word test effect (1.98 SD). OLS estimates are six times smaller (0.13 SD), suggesting either substantial selection bias or heterogeneous treatment effects where compliers benefit more than always-takers.</p>

                        <p><strong>The mechanism is rejection, not affirmation:</strong> Decomposing the index reveals education operates through weakened external beliefs, not strengthened internal ones. Completing junior high reduces agreement that success depends on luck, family wealth, or social status by 40-50 percentage points. But it doesn't increase agreement that success depends on effort, education, or hard work—those coefficients are statistically zero. Schooling doesn't make people embrace meritocracy; it makes them reject fatalism.</p>

                        <h3>Implications</h3>
                        <p>This reveals how education shapes worldviews beyond skills. The finding that effects concentrate among compliers (females, rural residents) suggests the experience of completing junior high—particularly for those who wouldn't have otherwise—fundamentally shifts beliefs about social mobility. Those induced to stay in school learned that outcomes aren't predetermined by birth circumstances. Whether this optimism proves justified in China's actual labor market is a separate question, but the psychological transformation is real and substantial.</p>
