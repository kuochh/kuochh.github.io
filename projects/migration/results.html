                        <p><strong>The stickiness gap:</strong> Young adults from two-parent households are 3.9 percentage points less likely to leave their hometown commuting zone—a 12% reduction in migration probability. This gap persists across all education levels and throughout the twenties, suggesting it's not simply about college choices or early career constraints.</p>

                        <p><strong>The price of home:</strong> Using a structural model that separates psychological attachment from economic constraints, young adults from two-parent households value staying in their hometown 35% more than those from other family structures—a 'home premium' that persists even after accounting for wage differences and moving costs.</p>

                        <p><strong>Not about the money:</strong> Migration costs are nearly identical between groups, ruling out financial constraints as the driver. The difference comes entirely from stronger emotional anchors to home locations.</p>

                        <p><strong>Implications:</strong> This reveals a deeper story about informal insurance in the US. The stronger home premium for two-parent households may reflect the family support network they can access—both parents providing a safety net that makes leaving less attractive. Young adults from other family structures, with potentially weaker local safety nets, show greater willingness to migrate despite facing similar costs. This geographic stickiness of those with stronger family support ironically contributes to declining dynamism: those best equipped with family resources to take risks are least likely to pursue opportunities elsewhere. As formal social safety nets weaken, family structure increasingly determines who can afford to stay home and who must seek opportunity elsewhere, potentially exacerbating regional inequality.</p>
