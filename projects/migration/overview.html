                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Americans aren't moving like they used to. Internal migration has steadily declined since the 1980s—a troubling shift that traps workers in struggling regions while booming cities face labor shortages. The numbers are striking: nearly 70% of young adults now live in the same place where they grew up, despite this being the life stage when people traditionally chase opportunities across the country. While numerous explanations exist, estimates consistently suggest staggeringly high migration costs—often requiring a 100% wage increase to justify a move. The image from <em>Home Alone</em> of family members flying in from across the country for Christmas or Thanksgiving is becoming less accurate each year; increasingly, families never scattered in the first place. This paper explores the non-economic forces behind this geographic stickiness.</p>

                        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Does childhood family structure determine geographic futures? Specifically, are young adults from two-parent households more likely to stay put?</li>
                            <li>What's the price tag on staying home? How does family structure affect the economic trade-offs of migration?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p>Behind these questions lies a puzzle: why do people pass up substantially higher wages elsewhere? While researchers typically focus on job markets and moving costs, family ties might be the hidden force anchoring people to hometowns—through everything from childcare help to parental connections.</p>
