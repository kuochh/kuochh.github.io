                        <h3>Data</h3>
                        <p>I track ~9,000 teenagers through their transition to adulthood using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), capturing the critical window from ages 17 to 30—traditionally when Americans scatter for college, careers, and new beginnings. This rich panel data uniquely documents both origins and destinations, along with detailed family backgrounds.</p>

                        <h3>Methods</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Identifying patterns:</strong> Fixed effects models strip away confounding factors to isolate a clean relationship: how does growing up in a two-parent household shape migration decisions? This approach essentially compares otherwise similar young adults who differ only in childhood family structure.</li>

                            <li><strong>Understanding mechanisms:</strong> A structural model that frames migration as an economic decision with a psychological twist. The model disentangles three competing forces:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The "home premium"—quantifying how much salary people sacrifice to remain near family</li>
                                    <li>Migration costs—capturing both moving expenses and the emotional toll of leaving</li>
                                    <li>Earning differentials—the actual wage gains available elsewhere, estimated from external data</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Innovation</h3>
                        <p>My approach recognizes that "home" isn't just another location—it's unique. By creating a distinct "home" option (staying put or returning), and estimating all parameters separately by family structure, I can test whether two-parent families create stronger geographic anchors. Are these anchors forged through emotional bonds, economic advantages, or both? The model provides the first empirical answer.</p>
